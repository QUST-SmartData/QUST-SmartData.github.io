#### [CLECC](https://github.com/QUST-SmartData/)


- **Highlight**: Medicine AI application

- **Title**: *Application of a course learning strategy based on structural prior and Ebbinghaus forgetting curve for ultrasound gallbladder lesion classification*

- **Introduction**: In ultrasound images, traditional deep learning models face challenges in classifying gallbladder lesions due to the high similarity in texture features between gallbladder tissue and surrounding soft tissue. To address this issue, this paper proposes a curriculum learning and training strategy that combines structural priors and Ebbinghaus forgetting curves. Inspired by the development of human visual acuity, we use the Relative Total Variance (RTV) method to extract structural priors from images, replacing traditional Gaussian blur processing, to more effectively separate texture and structural information, guiding the model to focus on key anatomical structural features. At the same time, a course learning strategy was designed based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve to optimize the learning process of the model and enhance its ability to remember and discriminate key features. The experimental results show that this method has achieved significant results in improving the accuracy and robustness of gallbladder lesion classification, providing strong support for automatic diagnosis of ultrasound images.
